## Compiler

As the publishing year of the book suggests, it follows the C89 standards. However, we may use some new features of the C99 or C11 within the codes, which are supported by all modern compilers. You can take a look at this [wikipedia page][1] for a brief history of the C standards. All of the codes were tested with the `gcc` compiler.
